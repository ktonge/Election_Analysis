# Election_Analysis
## Project Overview
As an excercise for our data bootcamp, we were given the hypothetical situation of being tasked by a Colorado Board of Elections employee to automate certain tasks, specifically to audit a recent local congressional election 
We were tasked with finding the following data
1. The total number of votes cast
2. A complete list of candidates who received votes
3. The percentage of votes each candidate won
4. The total # of votes each candidate won 
5. The winner of the election based on popular vote

## Resources
Data Source: election_results.csv
Software: Python 3.7.6 and Visual Studio Code 1.73.1

## Summary
The analysis of the election shows that:
There were 369,711 total votes cast for three candidates, with the following results:
1. Diana Degette received 73.8% of the vote with 85,213 votes 
2. Charles Casper Stockham received 23.0% of the vote with 272,892 votes
3. Raymon Anthony Doane recieved 3.1% of the votes with 11,606 votes 

> The winner of the election was Diana Degette with 73.8% of the vote with 85,213 votes.  

# Election Audit Summary
I had significant challenges getting the code to run at all. I kept repeatedly getting the following error message. 
![Error Image](https://github.com/ktonge/Election_Analysis/blob/main/Screenshot%202022-11-10%20224354.png)
Overall I was able to show that Jefferson had 10.5% of the turnout, 38855 total votes.  I am planning on resubmitting this challenge. 

I was honestly suprised how much I struggled with this challenge, Python seems really intuitive. I got alot of identation errors, but I was following the provided code really closely.  I tried looking at alot of different potential solutions and comparing my code but I couldn't get the full results.
