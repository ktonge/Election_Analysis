# Election_Analysis
## Project Overview
As an excercise for our data bootcamp, we were given the hypothetical situation of being tasked by a Colorado Board of Elections employee to automate certain tasks, specifically to audit a recent local congressional election 
We were tasked with finding the following data
1. The total number of votes cast
2. A complete list of candidates who received votes
3. The percentage of votes each candidate won
4. The total # of votes each candidate won 
5. The winner of the election based on popular vote

After writing code in python to find this information, we looked at which counties voted most in the election, and what percentage of the total votes each county represented.  

## Resources and Results 
Data Source: election_results.csv
Software: Python 3.7.6 and Visual Studio Code 1.73.1
I used python to create for loops to run through the election data, determining the information above, then writing that information to a text file. To break things down further, we also looked at voter information broke down by county, and their total voter turn out.
